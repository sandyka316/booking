                <h2 class="h3 mb-3">How We Started</h2>
                <p>BookSpace was founded in 2023 by a group of remote workers who struggled to find suitable places to work from. After bouncing between coffee shops, libraries, and makeshift home offices, they realized there was a need for a platform that would streamline the process of finding and booking professional workspaces.</p>
                <p>What started as a simple idea has grown into a comprehensive booking platform with hundreds of spaces across multiple cities.</p>
